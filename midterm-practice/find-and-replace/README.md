Write a C function with the following signature that gets three strings as input parameters: char* str, char* pattern and char* altPattern. Your function should searches for pattern in str and replaces all occurrences of pattern by altPattern and return the resulting string as its return value.

Please note that the function should not modify the content of the three char arrays passed to it as its input parameters while doing the mentioned task.

<i>Hint: you may use `malloc` function to allocate memory for storing the string that your function returns.</i>

```c
char* findAndReplace(char* str, char* pattern, char* altPattern)
{

     ...

}
```
