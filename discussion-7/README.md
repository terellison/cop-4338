During this module's video lecture, I implemented a binary search tree using the C programming language.

1. Use this implementation of BSTs to write a program that receives a string from the standard input stream and prints out the letters of the input string in alphabetical order after removing the duplicate letters. For example, for the input "hello world", the output looks like " dehlorw".

2. Predict the average time complexity of your program as a function of n (the length of the input string).

3. Do you think that your solution is the fastest solution possible? If not, propose a way to improve it.

4. Compare your solution with your classmates'.
